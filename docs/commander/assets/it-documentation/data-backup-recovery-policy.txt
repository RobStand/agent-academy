HOW TO PROTECT YOUR DATA

Best Practices:
1. **Save to approved locations**:

   - Network file shares (department files)
   - Do NOT save only to local C: drive

2. **Enable OneDrive sync**:
   - Ensures files automatically backed up
   - Access files from any device
   - Automatic version control

3. **Use version history**:
   - Revert to previous versions if needed
   - Protected against accidental changes
   - Available in OneDrive and SharePoint

4. **Don't disable sync**:
   - Keeps cloud and local copies in sync
   - Provides redundancy
   - Enables disaster recovery

5. **Avoid USB drives for primary storage**:
   - Use for temporary transfer only
   - Not backed up by IT
   - Easily lost or damaged
