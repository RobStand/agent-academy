Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Setup Guide

Document Version: 2.5
Last Updated: December 2024
Document Owner: IT Security Team

INTRODUCTION
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your Contoso accounts. Instead of just a password, you'll need to provide a second form of verification. This guide will help you set up and use MFA.

WHY MFA IS REQUIRED
Passwords alone are no longer sufficient protection:
- 81% of data breaches involve stolen passwords
- MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks
- Required for compliance (SOX, GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Protects company and personal data
- Industry best practice

Required for:
- All Contoso employees
- Contractors and vendors
- Access to any company system
- VPN connections
- Email access from external networks

WHAT IS MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION?

MFA requires two things to sign in:
1. **Something you know**: Your password
2. **Something you have**: Your phone or security key

Common verification methods:
- Mobile app notification (Microsoft Authenticator)
- Text message with code
- Phone call with code
- Hardware security key
- Biometric (fingerprint, face recognition on mobile)

MFA ENROLLMENT

Who Must Enroll:
- All employees on first login
- Within 7 days of starting employment
- Before accessing any company systems
- After password reset (in some cases)

Enrollment Deadline:
- New employees: Day 1
- Existing employees: Already completed
- Contractors: Before system access granted
