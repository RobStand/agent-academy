# üö® Mission 07: Extend agents with Azure AI

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CODENAME: `OPERATION AZURE INTELLIGENCE`

> **‚è±Ô∏è Operation Time Window:** `~60 minutes`  

## üéØ Mission Brief

Your agent is powerful on its own, but connecting it to Azure AI unlocks enterprise-grade capabilities. This mission will teach you how to use Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search to create intelligent, custom experiences that go beyond out-of-the-box functionality.

By mission's end, you'll have deployed a custom AI model in Azure AI Foundry, integrated it into your agent through custom prompt actions, created a searchable knowledge base in Azure AI Search, and connected it all to your agent for expanded knowledge and capabilities.

## üîé Objectives

In this mission, you'll learn:

1. Understanding what Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) and Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) mean in the context of Microsoft Copilot Studio
1. Learning why and when to use BYOM and BYOD capabilities with your agents
1. Exploring how BYOM and BYOD integrate with Copilot Studio agents
1. Deploying AI models in Azure AI Foundry and connecting them via custom prompt actions
1. Creating searchable indexes in Azure AI Search and using them as knowledge sources

## ü§ñ What does Bring Your Own Model mean?

Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) allows you to use custom or third-party AI models with your Copilot Studio agents instead of relying solely on the models built into Copilot Studio. This gives you flexibility to choose specialized models that best fit your specific use case. With BYOM, you can choose a model for your agent that meets your specific needs.

### What does BYOM enable?

- **Custom AI capabilities** - use specialized models trained for specific domains like legal, medical, or financial services.
- **Model flexibility** - select from various model providers including Azure OpenAI, open-source models, or your own fine-tuned models.
- **Control and compliance** - maintain control over model selection, deployment location, and data handling to meet regulatory requirements.
- **Cost optimization** - choose models that balance performance with cost based on your workload requirements.

### Types of models you can bring

- **Azure OpenAI models** - GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other models deployed in your Azure subscription.
- **Azure AI model catalog** - access 1900+ models from the extensive Azure AI Foundry model catalog.
- **Custom fine-tuned models** - models you've trained or fine-tuned on your specific data.
- **Open-source models** - popular models like Llama, Mistral, or Phi deployed in Azure.

## üìä What does Bring Your Own Data mean?

Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) enables you to connect your own enterprise data sources to your Copilot Studio agents, allowing them to provide grounded, accurate responses based on your organization's information.

### What does BYOD enable?

- **Enterprise knowledge** - ground your agent's responses in your organization's documents, databases, and systems.
- **Accurate information** - reduce hallucinations by connecting to authoritative data sources.
- **Real-time data** - access current information from your systems rather than relying on pre-trained knowledge.
- **Contextual responses** - provide answers that are relevant to your organization's specific context and terminology.

### Types of data sources you can bring

- **Azure AI Search** - searchable indexes of documents, websites, and structured data.
- **SharePoint** - documents and files stored in SharePoint sites.
- **OneDrive** - files stored in OneDrive for Business.
- **Dataverse** - structured data from your Power Platform environment.
- **Custom connectors** - any data source accessible via API.

## üéØ Why use BYOM and BYOD in Microsoft Copilot Studio agents?

While Copilot Studio provides powerful out-of-the-box capabilities, BYOM and BYOD unlock advanced scenarios that make your agents truly enterprise-ready.

### Reasons to use BYOM

1. **Specialized expertise**
    - Use domain-specific models that understand industry terminology and context better than general-purpose models.
    - Example: a medical terminology model for healthcare agents.

1. **Performance optimization**
    - Select smaller, faster models for simple tasks and larger models for complex reasoning.
    - Balance response time with capability requirements.

1. **Compliance and governance**
    - Deploy models in specific Azure regions to meet data residency requirements.
    - Maintain full control over model versions and updates.

1. **Cost management**
    - Use cost-effective models for high-volume, low-complexity interactions.
    - Reserve premium models for complex scenarios.

1. **Custom capabilities**
    - Leverage models fine-tuned on your organization's data and use cases.
    - Implement specialized capabilities not available in standard models.

### Reasons to use BYOD

1. **Accuracy and reliability**
    - Ground responses in authoritative enterprise data rather than general knowledge.
    - Reduce the risk of hallucinations and incorrect information.

1. **Current information**
    - Access real-time data from your systems.
    - Ensure users receive up-to-date information.

1. **Enterprise context**
    - Provide responses that understand your organization's terminology, processes, and policies.
    - Reference internal documents, guidelines, and knowledge bases.

1. **Compliance**
    - Keep sensitive data within your environment rather than sending it to external services.
    - Maintain audit trails of data access.

1. **Personalization**
    - Tailor responses based on user roles, departments, or permissions.
    - Surface relevant information from the right data sources.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How BYOM and BYOD work in Microsoft Copilot Studio agents

Understanding how these capabilities integrate with your agent helps you design effective solutions.

### BYOM integration architecture
